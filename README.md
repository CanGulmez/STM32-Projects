# STM32 Project using STM32Cube Firmware 

STM32 is the recently the popular microcontroller solution. It is 
powered Arm Cortex-M processor. So, I've decided focusing on STM32
programming. In this repository, I target to create STM32 projects
that I can do. Lastly, I wanna give a some information about tools
that I use:

+ Environment: `Visual Studio Code`
+ Project: `PlatformIO`
+ Firmware: `STM32Cube Firmware`
+ Boards: Especially `STM32F` series

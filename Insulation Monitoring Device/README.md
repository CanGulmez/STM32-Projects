# INSULATION MONITORING DEVICE - FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENT

This project was developed to insulation monitoring for electric 
vechiles. In electric cars, the insulation monitoring system measure
the insulation resistance level. If anything goes wrong (electric
leakage, or etc.), this system find it and responds in different way.
In this project, this response is to trigger the buzzer system.

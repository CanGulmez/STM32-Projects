# Data Transceiver via SPI Interface 

Data transciever is one of the most required skill in 
digital or analog systems. So, There are the a lot of
serial communication protocols like I2C, SPI, CAN, etc.
In this project, I focused the SPI interface with 
master and slave modes. I hope it will be useful...

+ Data Transceiver via UART/USART 
   
Data transciever is one of the most required skill in 
digital or analog systems. So, There are the a lot of
serial communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART/USART.
In this firmware, I focused the UART interface to aim
transmission and reception. I hope it will be useful...
